### What has it been like?

@ul[squares text-08]

- Slow at times (often)
  - Documentation incomplete
  - Scattered information
  - Lack of example code
  - Reporting bugs
  - Some were already fixed but not released in v8.1 
    - This was a big frustration
- Core concepts were changed
- Working out my preferred way 
  - e.g. in migrations
- Trying to find sample code
  - Where documentation was M.I.A.
  - This is a recurring theme
- uSync has worked really well 
  - Initially some bugs, but quickly fixed
  - It takes a bit of planning, and discipline

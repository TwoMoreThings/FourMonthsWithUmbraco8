### My V8 experience

@ul[squares text-08]

- Full-time with v8 since end of April
  - I joined Ingeniuus
  - Working on a project to be delivered Jan 2020
  - Risk was low because of the delivery date
  - Decision was already taken to go with v8
  - With hindsight...
  - I'd make the same choice
- This is a collection of stuff I've learned
  - Thank you to Ingeniuus for allowing me to share it
- What's your level of experience?
